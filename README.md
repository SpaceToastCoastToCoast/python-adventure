#Python Text Adventure
A simple text adventure to practice `raw_input`, `print`, `if/else`, arrays and `import` in Python. This project can be expanded to include graphics, if desired.

###Game details
This is a simple text adventure in the style of early 80s adventure games. Emphasis is placed upon problem solving and multiple paths. The game runs on the command line and thus is compatible with any OS that can run Python.

Basic commands are used to interact with the game. Items of interest will be mentioned in the prompts before each level. The commands required are broad but sensible--"use" and "take" are common examples. You can also type "list" at any time to see your inventory.

###To use
Open a terminal in the project folder and type `python entry.py`. You should see an ASCII graphic and a prompt to begin the game.
